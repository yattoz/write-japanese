Write Japanese is an Android app that teaches the Japanese character set, including katakana, hiragana, and over 3000 kanji characters. It features animated demonstrations, realtime stroke order evaluation, detailed feedback, customizable character lists, kanji stories as a memorization aid, and a Spaced Repetition System (SRS) that schedules learning repeats over several days. It has been on sale in the Google App store for several years, and was open-sourced under the GPL in 2023.

It is recommended to build using the free Android Studio IDE.
